## Simple ncurses-based "Conway's Game of Life" simulator https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

Have libncurses5-dev installed on your linux box to be able to build it.

**Ctrl-C** or **q** - to exit

**-** - slow down the simulation

**+** - speed up the simulation

**r** - to fell the board with a random pattern (as at startup)

**c** - to clear the board

**g** - to spawn a glider from the top left corner into the board (carefull, it is addictive)
